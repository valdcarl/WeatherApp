# WeatherApp
## Created by Carlos A. Valdez
This project has been added to my resume for organizations/job-postings

I developed a weather application using React Native and Expo for iOS and Android platforms,
implementing a dynamic, clean, and intuitive user interface with real-time weather data updates
through the OpenWeather API services. I leveraged various React Native and Expo libraries as I feel
it is important to demonstrate these basic principles for entry-level positions seeking team members
with a core understanding of React Native | Expo.
